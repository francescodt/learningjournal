**_Seeing it some of it come together_**
We've set the framework with .html, and the presentation is worked on with .css, now with javascript we can change how the webpage behaves.  

Adding in each layer as we go between just html, html + css, and then all three tied together is helpful in knowing what each do, visually and functionally.  

__*Javascript and how it looks*__
There is an object, and a method.   
The document object represents the entire web page. You can access members of an object using a dot between the object and the method, which is called the member operator.  
The method of the document allows new content to be written into the page where the script element sits. Inside of the method can exist parameters, which is information.
