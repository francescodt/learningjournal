# What did we learn

Well, I literally don't have enough room to begin to describe how I felt about using a terminal prior to today.  
Now, I feel much more inclined and after many attempts of git status, git add, etc, am much closer to a feeling of enjoyment in such a program.

Essentially, the ability of being able to take a clone from github, putting that into a terminal, working that clone in a code editor (or text editor?) and making changes in said editor. Once you've done what you need to do, you have the ability to now add, push, and fetch that back out to your web source. 

Common codes used are:
__*Git status - use a lot*__ - Let's you know if there are any changes that need to be made since your last commit  
git remote -v - Lets you know what is being fetched or pushed  
git add <file> - to update what wil be committed  
git checkout -- <file> - to discard changes in working directory  
git reset HEAD <file> - to unstage (revert back)  
git commit -m '<add or update file markdown examples>'   
  git add <file name>  
  git update 'what you did here'  
git push - to publish local commit  
git commit -m "your message goes here"  
git push origin master - pushes information out to github

There are plenty more, but these seem to be the main ones to work with for now.
