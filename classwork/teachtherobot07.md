__*Script*__  
- A series of isntructions.  
- Computers can follow step-by-step instructions  
Comptuers are not human, and cannot complete complex tasks without detailed instructions.  
Starting with the big picture of what you want to achieve and break that down into smaller steps.  
- Define the goal  
- Design the script  
- Code each step  

__*Expressions*__  
Broadly speaking, there are two types of expressions.    
- Expressions that just assign a value to a variable  
* var color = beige  
- Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value  
* var area = 3 * 2  

__*Operators*__  
Operators allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. Expressions rely on these.  
&& - and  
|| - or  
! - not


__*Arithmetic operators*__  
Additon +  
Subtraction -  
Increment ++  
Decrement --  
Modulus %  

__*String Operator*__  
The only string operator is the + symbol.  
You would write two things in a variable joined by a + to make one expression.  
var done = 'i did' + 'it'  

__*Functions*__  
Functions allow you to group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.  

Delcaring a function - To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.  

Calling a function - Having declared a function, you can then execute all of the statements between it's curly races with just one line of code.  

Functions need specific information to perform it's task. In such cases, when you delcare the function you give it parameters. Inside the function, parameters act like variables.
