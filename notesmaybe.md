## Day 1

Add the link to the website portion on edit (upper middle right)
???
Github should basically be set-up

???<br>
Install a lot of things

## Day 2
*Learn about git*
<ol> <li>Version control system</li>
<li> history of changes to your files</li>
<li>View, apply, and remove those changes</li>
<li<Keep all your project files in one repository</li></ol>

Save file = commit.
-name = -m 'message'

Creates snapshots on the timeline of the project. 
Git keeps track of what the file looked like at different points in time. 

Each commit has a label that points to it.
HEAD = label for "you are here" (read as most recent)
You can assign messages to commits.
Messages are like writing a caption for your snapshot.

Git is the versioning system/command line tool, github is a hosting service, task managing "cloud" for projects

_**git + github = awesome**_

*Github*
Allows you to share code with others, and an online place to store your code.
Can use git to help manage team's work - can allow you to keep changes separate before it's added in

Repository - collections of files that you've told git to pay attention to
Generally, one project = one repository

_**how to add a clone to another repository**_ (actions in terminal)
cd desktop
ls - shows what the list on your desktop is
ls -a shows the hidden files (things with .infront of them)
git clone + link

cd + new name
ls (to see what's inside)


*use code . to open VS*

__*Git status - use a lot__* - Let's you know if there are any changes that need to be made since your last commit
git remote -v - Lets you know what is being fetched or pushed
git add <file> - to update what wil be committed
git checkout -- <file> - to discard changes in working directory
git reset HEAD <file> - to unstage (revert back)
git commit -m '<add or update file markdown examples>' 
  git add <file name>
  git update 'what you did here'
git push to publish local commit
git commit -m "your message goes here"
git push origin master -
