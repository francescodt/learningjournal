## Day 2
*Learn about git*
<ol> <li>Version control system</li>
<li> history of changes to your files</li>
<li>View, apply, and remove those changes</li>
<li<Keep all your project files in one repository</li></ol>

Save file = commit.
-name = -m 'message'

Creates snapshots on the timeline of the project. 
Git keeps track of what the file looked like at different points in time. 

Each commit has a label that points to it.
HEAD = label for "you are here" (read as most recent)
You can assign messages to commits.
Messages are like writing a caption for your snapshot.

Git is the versioning system/command line tool, github is a hosting service, task managing "cloud" for projects

__**git + github = awesome**__

*Github*
Allows you to share code with others, and an online place to store your code.
Can use git to help manage team's work - can allow you to keep changes separate before it's added in

Repository - collections of files that you've told git to pay attention to
Generally, one project = one repository
