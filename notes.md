## Day 1
Create the repistory (MIT)  
Change the source to master and the theme to the best looking one.  
Add the link to the website portion on edit (upper middle right)  
???  
Github should basically be set-up  

???  
Install a lot of things  

## Day 2  
*Learn about git*  
<ol> <li>Version control system</li>  
<li> history of changes to your files</li>  
<li>View, apply, and remove those changes</li>  
<li<Keep all your project files in one repository</li></ol>  

Save file = commit.  
-name = -m 'message'  

Creates snapshots on the timeline of the project.  
Git keeps track of what the file looked like at different points in time.  

Each commit has a label that points to it.  
HEAD = label for "you are here" (read as most recent)  
You can assign messages to commits.  
Messages are like writing a caption for your snapshot.  

Git is the versioning system/command line tool, github is a hosting service, task managing "cloud" for projects  

_**git + github = awesome**_  

*Github*  
Allows you to share code with others, and an online place to store your code.  
Can use git to help manage team's work - can allow you to keep changes separate before it's added in  

Repository - collections of files that you've told git to pay attention to  
Generally, one project = one repository  

_**how to add a clone to another repository**_ (actions in terminal)  
cd desktop  
ls - shows what the list on your desktop is  
ls -a shows the hidden files (things with .infront of them)  
git clone + link  

cd + new name  
ls (to see what's inside)  


*use code . to open VS*  

__*Git status - use a lot*__ - Let's you know if there are any changes that need to be made since your last commit  
git remote -v - Lets you know what is being fetched or pushed  
git add <file> - to update what wil be committed  
git checkout -- <file> - to discard changes in working directory  
git reset HEAD <file> - to unstage (revert back)  
git commit -m '<add or update file markdown examples>'   
  git add <file name>  
  git update 'what you did here'  
git push - to publish local commit  
git commit -m "your message goes here"  
git push origin master -   

*git flow*  
A-C-P  

__*HTML*__ - hyper text markup language  
This is what you use to structure your webpage.  
Semantic elements are descriptors that tell you where to put things.  
- < article> < /article>  
- < div> < /div>  

< Head>< /Head> Title, metadata, link style, js  

### example of html page  
<*!DOCTYPE html>  
<*html>  
  <*head>  
    <*title>htmldemo</*title>\
  <*/head>\
  <*body>\
    <*header>\
